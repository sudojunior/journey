# transcript explanation

- `-` = means new 'spoken' line
  This is entirely upto the commiter for how they like to do it, if we had a set standard we'd state it in the contribution guidelines. For now keep it to a reasonable length, but don't over do it (i.e. have one line for each word or one paragraph per line).

  [../2018/music/AvrilLavigne/HeadAboveWater.md] is a good example to start with (at the time of writing this, it was the only one to have a partial transcript)
  
- `{m:ss-m:ss}` - means the time in which it happened (from and to)
  The general consensus is to keep the timestamp as short as possible while allowing the *yet to be* parser determine where and when the line should appear. However, if a transcript goes into hours, then some adaptations may be required.
