- {0:00 - 0:26}

- {0:26 - 0:31} I've got to keep the calm before the storm
- {0:33 - 0:37} I don't want less, I don't want more
- {0:40 - 0:44} Must bar the windows and the doors
- {0:46 - 0:50} To keep me save to keep me warm

- {0:53 - 0:57} Yeah my life is what I’m fighting for
- {0:59 - 1:03} Can’t part the sea, can’t reach the shore
- {1:06 - 1:10} And my voice becomes the driving force
- {1:12 - 1:16} I won’t let this pull me overboard

- {1:17 - 1:21} God keep my head above water
- {1:21 - 1:23} Don't let me drown, 
- {1:23 - 1:24} It gets harder
- {1:24 - 1:28} I’ll meet you there at the altar
- {1:29 - 1:31} As I fall down to my knees
- {1:32 - 1:35} Don’t let me drown
- {1:36 - 1:40} Don’t let me drown
