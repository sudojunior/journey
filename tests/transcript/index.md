- {0:03-0:07} Mysterious Narrator: Legends. Stories scattered through time.
- {0:08-0:13} ~: Mankind has grown quite fond of recounting the exploits,
- {$-0:19} ~: ... forgetting so easily that we are remnants, byproducts, of a forgotten past.
- {0:20-0:24} ~: Man, born from dust, was strong, wise, and resourceful.
- {$-0:27} ~: But he was born into an unforgiving world.
- {0:28-0:31} ~: An inevitable darkness, creatures of destruction.
- {0:32-0:37} ~: The creatures of Grimm set their sights on man and all of his creations.
- {$-0:41} ~: These forces clashed and it seemed the darkness was intent
- {$-0:45} ~: ... on returning man's brief existance to the void.
- {0:46-0:49} ~: However, even the smallest spark of hope
- {$-0:53} ~: ... is enough to ignite change, and in time, man's passion,
- {$-0:56} ~: ... resourcefulness, and ingenuity led them to the tools 
- {$-0:59} ~: ... that would help even the odds.
- {$-1:04} ~: This power was appropriately named "Dust".
- {$-1:08} ~: Nature's wrath in hand, man lit their way through the darkness,
- {$-1:12} ~: ... and in the shadow's absence came strength, civilization, 
- {$-1:15} ~: ... and most importantly, life.
- {1:17-1:21} ~: But even the most brilliant lights eventually flicker and die.
- {1:24-1:29} ~: And when they are gone... darkness will return.
- {1:37-1:39} ~: So you may prepare your guardians,
- {1:40-1:44} ~: ... build your monuments to a so-called free-world,
- {$-1:51} ~: ... but take heed... there will be no victory in strength.
- {$-1:55} Ozpin: But perhaps victory is in the simpler things that you've long forgotten.
- {$-2:00} ~: Things that require a smaller, more honest soul.
- {2:13-2:18} Roman: Do you have any idea how hard it is to find a Dust shop open this late?
- {$-2:20} Shopkeep: P-please! Just take my Lien and leave!
- {$-2:23} Roman: Shhh, shhh, shhh, shhh, calm down, we're not here for your money.
- {2:24-2:26} ~: Grab the dust.
- {2:33-2:36} Henchman: Crystals. Burn. Uncut.
- {2:44-2:47} ~: Alright kid, put your hands where I can see 'em.
- {2:50-2:53} ~: Hey, I said hands in the air! You got a death wish or something!?
- {$-2:54} Ruby: Huh? 
- {2:57-2:58} ~: Yes?
- {$-3:00} Henchman: I said, put your hands in the air, now!
- {$-3:02} Ruby: Are you... robbing me?
- {$-3:03} Henchman: Yes!
- {3:04-3:05} Ruby: Oh.
- {3:05-3:06} Henchman: Hey!
- {3:05-3:06} Ruby: Hyah!
- {3:12-3:13} Henchman: Freeze!
- {3:14-3:16} ðŸŽµ: This will be the day we're waiting for.
- {$-3:19} ðŸŽµ: This will be the day we open up the door.
- {$-3:22} ðŸŽµ: I don't wanna hear your absolution.
- {$-3:25} ðŸŽµ: Hope you're ready for a revolution.
- {$-3:27} ðŸŽµ: Welcome to a world of new solutions
- {$-3:30} ðŸŽµ: Welcome to a world of bloody evolution-
- {3:33-3:35} Roman: Okayyy...
- {3:36-3:37} ~: Get her!
- {3:57-3:59} ~: You were worth every cent. Truly you were.
- {$-4:03} ~: Well, Red, I think we can all say it's been an eventful evening,
- {$-4:07} ~: ... and as much as I'd love to stick around...
- {$-4:10} ~: I'm afraid this is where we part ways.
- {4:23-4:25} Ruby: You okay if I go after him?
- {$-4:26} Shopkeep: Uh huh.
- {4:30-4:31} Ruby: Hey!
- {4:33-4:34} Roman: Persistant...
- {4:45-4:47} ~: End of the line, Red.
- {4:55-4:58} ~: Whoa-ho-ho! Huh?
- {5:02-5:03} Glenda: Hm.
- {5:14-5:16} Roman: We got a Huntress!
- {5:27-5:28} ~: The hell?
- {6:24-6:26} Ruby: You're a Huntress!
- {6:28-6:30} ~: Can I have your autograph?
- {$-6:32} Glenda: I hope you realize that your actions tonight
- {$-6:34} ~: ... will not be taken lightly, young lady.
- {$-6:37} ~: You put yourself and others in great danger.
- {$-6:39} Ruby: They started it.
- {$-6:41} Glenda: If it were up to me, you'd be sent home...
- {$-6:44} ~: With a pat on the back...
- {6:46-6:47} ~: And a slap on the wrist.
- {$-6:49} Ruby: Eeek!
- {$-6:52} Glenda: But... there is someone here who would like to meet you.
- {6:56-6:58} Ozpin: Ruby Rose...
- {7:00-7:01} ~: You...
- {7:03-7:04} ~: ... have silver eyes.
- {7:05-7:06} Ruby: Um...
- {$-7:10} Ozpin: So! Where did you learn to do this?
- {$-7:12} Ruby: S-Signal Academy.
- {$-7:16} Ozpin: They taught you to use one of the most dangerous weapons ever designed?
- {$-7:18} Ruby: Well, one teacher in particular.
- {7:19-7:20} Ozpin: I see...
- {7:28-7:31} ~: It's just that I've only seen one other scythe-wielder
- {$-7:33} ~: ... of that skill before.
- {$-7:35} ~: A dusty, old crow.
- {$-7:37} Ruby: Mmmmm! Thash muh unkul!
- {7:38-7:40} ~: Sorry, that's my Uncle Qrow!
- {$-7:42} ~: He's a teacher at Signal!
- {$-7:45} ~: I was complete garbage before he took me under his wing.
- {$-7:49} ~: Any now I'm all like - Hooowaaah! Witchaaaa!
- {$-7:51} Ozpin: So I've noticed.
- {$-7:54} ~: And what is an adorable girl such as yourself
- {$-7:56} ~: ... doing at a school designed to train warriors?
- {$-8:01} Ruby: Ruby: Well... I want to be a Huntress.
- {$-8:02} Ozpin: You want to slay monsters?
- {$-8:03} Ruby: Yeah!
- {8:04-8:06} ~: I only have two more years of training left at Signal!
- {$-8:08} ~: And then I'm going to apply to Beacon!
- {$-8:10} ~: You see, my sister's starting there this year,
- {$-8:11} ~: ... and she's trying to become a Huntress,
- {$-8:14} ~: ... and I'm trying to become a Huntress 'cause I wanna help people.
- {$-8:16} ~: My parents always taught us to help others, so I thought,
- {$-8:18} ~: ... Hey, I might as well make a career out of it!
- {$-8:21} ~: I mean the police are alright, but Huntsmen and Huntresses
- {$-8:24} ~: ... are just so much more romantic and exciting and cool and really, gosh, you know!
- {8:28-8:30} Ozpin: Do you know who I am?
- {$-8:32} Ruby: You're Professor Ozpin.
- {$-8:34} ~: You're the headmaster at Beacon.
- {$-8:36} Ozpin: Hello.
- {$-8:38} Ruby: Nice to meet you.
- {$-8:40} Ozpin: You want to come to my school?
- {$-8:42} Ruby: More than anything.
- {$-8:43} Glenda: Hmmph.
- {$-8:45} Ozpin: Well, okay.
- {8:48-8:51} Yang: Oh, I can't believe my baby sister is going to Beacon with me!
- {$-8:53} ~: This is the best day ever!
- {$-8:54} Ruby: (gasping) Please stop.
- {$-8:56} Yang: (releasing her sister) But I'm so proud of you!
- {$-8:58} Ruby: Really Sis, it was nothing.
- {$-9:01} Yang: What do you mean? It was incredible!
- {$-9:04} ~: Everyone at Beacon is going to think you're the bee's knees.
- {$-9:06} Ruby: I don't want to be the "bee's knees", okay?
- {$-9:08} ~: I don't want to be any kind of knees!
- {$-9:10} ~: I just want to be a normal girl with normal knees.
- {9:11-9:13} Yang: What's with you? Aren't you excited?
- {$-9:14} Ruby: Of course I'm excited...
- {$-9:15} ~: I just...
- {$-9:17} ~: I got moved ahead two years.
- {$-9:19} ~: I don't want people to think I'm special or anything.
- {9:21-9:22} Yang: But you are special.
- {9:23-9:25} Cyril: The robbery was led by nefarious
- {$-9:28} ~: ... criminal Roman Torchwick, who continues to evade authorities.
- {$-9:32} ~: If you have any information on his whereabouts, please contact the Vale Police Department.
- {$-9:34} ~: Back to you, Lisa.
- {$-9:35} Lisa: Thank you, Cyril.
- {$-9:38} ~: In other news, this Saturday's Faunus Civil Rights protest
- {$-9:43} ~: ... turned dark when members of the White Fang disrupted the ceremony.
- {$-9:46} ~: The once peaceful organization has now disrupted...
- {9:50-9:52} Glynda: Hello, and welcome to Beacon!
- {$-9:53} Yang: Who's that?
- {$-9:54} Glynda: My name is Glynda Goodwitch.
- {$-9:55} Yang: Oh.
- {$-9:58} Glynda: You are among a privileged few who have received the honor of
- {$-10:01} ~: ... being selected to attend this prestigious academy!
- {$-10:04} ~: Our world is experiencing an incredible time of peace,
- {$-10:07} ~: ... and as future Huntsmen and Huntresses,
- {$-10:09} ~: ... it is your duty to uphold it.
- {$-10:12} ~: You have demonstrated the courage needed for such a task,
- {$-10:16} ~: and now it is our turn to provide you with the knowledge
- {$-10:19} ~: and the training to protect our world.
- {10:21-10:23} Ruby: Oh, wow!
- {10:28-10:30} ~: Look, you can see Signal from up here!
- {10:36-10:39} ~: I guess home isn't too far after all!
- {$-10:41} Yang: Beacon's our home, now.
- {10:46-10:49} Yang: Well... I guess the view isn't for everyone.
- {$-10:51} Ruby: It was a nice moment while it lasted.
- {$-10:53} Ruby: I wonder who we're gonna meet!
- {$-10:55} ~: I just hope they're better than Vomit Boy.
- {$-10:58} ~: Oh, Yang, gross! You have puke on your shoe!
- {$-11:01} ~: Yang: Gross, gross, gross, gross, gross, gross, gross, gross!
- {11:00-11:03} Ruby: Get-Get away! Get away from me! Get away from me! Get away from me! Get away from me!
- {11:14-11:17} ðŸŽµ: They see you as small and helpless,
- {$-11:19} ðŸŽµ: They see you as just a child.
- {$-11:22} ðŸŽµ: Surprise when they find out a warrior
- {$-11:24} ðŸŽµ: ... will soon run wild.
- {$-11:26} ðŸŽµ: Prepare for your greatest moments,
- {$-11:29} ðŸŽµ: Prepare for your finest hour.
- {$-11:31} ðŸŽµ: The dream that you've always dreamed
- {$-11:34} ðŸŽµ: ... is suddenly about to flower.
